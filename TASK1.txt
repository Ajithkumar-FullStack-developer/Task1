**HTTP1.1 and HTTP2**
    HTTP- as a Hypertext Transfer Protocol.
    The protocol that govern how the information is transmitted between server and cilent.
 
    Different between HTTP1.1 and HTTP2

 **HTTP1.1 While revolutionary at the time,
         HTTP/1.1 has certain limitations that become more apparent as web applications grow in complexity and size.

    HTTP1.1 Key Characteristics 

        1. sequentail Request
            Each request and response is handling sequentailly, like a HTML and CSS,
            it must establish multiple connections, leading to potential inefficiencies.
        2. Compression
            it must support Compression of response data like a ZIP,
            it can lead additional overhead and dealing with large number of small resource
        3. No Multiplexing
            This is one of the biggest limitation of HTTP11.1 
            and its lacks the multiplex multiple request and response over th single (TCP) connections
        4. Header Overhead
            This redundancy can consume bandwidth unnecessarily, especially for small requests.
 **HTTP2 It aims to address these shortcomings while maintaining compatibility with existing web infrastructure.
          developed and standardized by the IETF in 2015.
    HTTP2 Key improvements

        1. Multiplexing
            Its allows multiple request and multiple response, send and received concurrently over single TCP connection.
            This significantly reduces latency and improves page load times, especially on complex websites.
        2.Header Compression
            This helps conserve bandwidth and speeds up data transmission and particularly beneficial for mobile users.
        3. Binary Protocol
            HTTP2 is Binary protocol 
            This simplifies parsing, reduces errors, and improves performance.
        4. Server Push
            This allows servers to proactively send resources to the client before they are explicitly requested.

**IP Addresses, ports, HTTP Menthods, and MAC Addresses**
        Networking is a foundational aspect of modern computing, enabling devices to communicate and share resources.
        Key concepts in this realm include IP addresses, ports, HTTP methods, and MAC addresses

    *IP Addresses (Internal Protocol)
            its unique identifier assigned to each device connected to a network.
            It allows devices to locate and communicate with each other over the internet,
            and local network.
        Types of IP Addresses
          1.IPv4: Are 32-bit numbers it is represented in the decimal format
            as four octets separated by dot (192.654.6.8)
          2.IPv6: Are 128-bit addresses and its is represented hexadecimal format 
            and its separated by colons (2002:0dh9:85k4:0000:ect,...)
    *Port
            It is a logical construct that identifies a specific process.
            Combination with an IP address to manage multiple connections simultaneously.
        They are categorized by
               Well-Known Ports (0-1023)
                Registered Ports (1024-49151)
                Dynamic or Private Ports (49152-650535)
        when it has default port is (HTTP is 80) (HTTPS is 443)
    
    *HTTP methods (HyperText Transfer Protocol)
            In this methods are actions that indicate the desired action to be performed on a given resource.
            These methods, also known as HTTP verbs
        HTTP Verbs
            1. GET-Retrieve the data from a server.
            2. POS-Send data to the srver to create a new resource. 
            3. PUT-Updateing the existing resource.
            4. DELETE-Remove the resource from the server.
            5. PATCH-Apply partial modification to resource.
    *MAC Address(Media Access control)
           MAC address is a hardware identifier that uniquely identifies each device on a network.
           it is composed six groups two hexadecimal digits and separated by colon or hyphen
           Example: (00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E)
        USAGE
            used in the data link layer of the OSI model.
            its ensuring the data delivered to the correct hardware device.

**Objects and Their Internal Representation in JavaScript
    # Relies heavily on the objects to store, manage, and manipulate data.
    # it represent everything from simple data structure to complex components and the entities.
    # obeject is a collection of key-value pairs
    # Where each key is a string or symbol and each value can be of any type primitive values, other object and etc,...

They are different way to create Object in JavaScript
    For Example
            Using Constructor
                const person = new object();
                person.name = "kumar";
                person.age = 25;
                Etc,.....
                
            Without Constructor
                const person = {
                    name: "Kumar",
                    age: 20;
                    ect,...
                }
